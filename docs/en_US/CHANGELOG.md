# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.2] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **Worker not restarted after user recreation**: When a user session ends (e.g., during service undeploy) and the ACL scanner temporarily fails to resolve the username to a UID, the UID was removed from the allowed list. When the user was recreated (e.g., during redeploy), the worker was not restarted because the UID was no longer in the allowed list and no ACL file change triggered a re-scan. The server now tracks usernames that failed to resolve during ACL scanning, and when a `/run/user/<uid>` directory appears for a UID not in the allowed list, performs a reverse lookup (UID → username) and checks against the unresolved list. If matched, an ACL re-scan is triggered, restoring the UID to the allowed list and starting the worker.

### Changed

- **UidTracker reports pending UIDs**: `UidEvents` now includes a `pending` list containing UIDs whose `/run/user/<uid>` directories were created but are not in the allowed list. The server uses this to detect potential ACL users that were temporarily unresolvable.
- **AclScanner tracks unresolved usernames**: A new `scanUidsWithUnresolved()` method returns both resolved UIDs and usernames that could not be resolved to UIDs, enabling the server to retry resolution when the user reappears.
- **handleAclChange now calls scanExisting**: After updating the allowed UID list, existing `/run/user/` directories are re-scanned so that newly-allowed UIDs with active sessions immediately get tracked and their workers started.

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-17

### Security

- **Symlink TOCTOU hardening for domain sockets**: `DomainSocket` chmod and `setModePath` now reject symlinked socket paths, preventing symlink-swap races that could redirect chmod onto an attacker-controlled file.
- **Atomic env file writes**: Environment files are now written using `O_EXCL | O_NOFOLLOW | O_CLOEXEC`, with content `fsync`-ed to a temp file before `rename` into place. This prevents partial-write corruption and resists symlink interception on shared directories.
- **Path traversal validation hardened in `CniLoader.isValidPluginType`**: Plugin type validation now rejects traversal sequences more strictly, closing gaps where malformed CNI configs could reference unexpected paths.
- **MAC and IP range parsing validation**: Range parsers now validate inputs more strictly, rejecting malformed or out-of-order ranges early before they reach ACL enforcement.

### Fixed

- **Critical: CNI ADD success no longer reported before state is durable**: The CNI ADD success response is now deferred until the attachment state file has been persisted successfully. Previously, a state-write failure after a successful network mount could leave the caller with a "success" response while the network had effectively been rolled back — an inconsistent state.
- **CNI ADD rolls back on state persistence failure**: When writing the state file fails after a network has been attached, the just-mounted network is now torn down instead of being left as an orphan resource.
- **Zig 0.16 `@typeInfo` tag compatibility**: Updated `@typeInfo` tag access (`.Fn` → `.@"fn"`) in `ManagedType` to match the renamed tag in Zig 0.16, avoiding a latent compile breakage against newer toolchains.

### Changed

- **CNI ADD failure contract**: On state-persistence failure the worker now rolls back the network and returns an error, rather than leaving an orphan network and reporting success.
- **Responser flush failure handling**: When the initial response flush fails, the worker no longer attempts a second error-response write (which would produce an invalid concatenated JSON document). It now logs a warning and gives up cleanly.
- **`WorkerManager.workers_dir` is now dependency-injected**: The `is_test` comptime branch has been removed; production and tests both inject the directory. Tests use `TempFileManager` to provide an isolated directory.

### Performance

- **UID lookup uses binary search**: `UidTracker` now resolves UIDs via binary search instead of a linear scan, reducing per-request cost as the number of tracked users grows.

### Internal

- Replaced six weak/fake assertions with real assertions, restoring meaningful coverage.
- Added tests covering the CNI ADD rollback path and the Responser flush-failure path.
- `TempFileManager` now uses `deleteTree` for recursive cleanup of temporary directories.
- This is a patch release focused on hardening, resilience, and test-quality improvements. No public API changes.

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **MAC-based access control**: ACL rules now support MAC address range restrictions. Define allowed MAC address ranges in ACL grants, and the system validates container MAC addresses against these ranges during CNI setup.
- **SLAAC IPv6 auto-detection**: A new SlaacDetector module automatically detects SLAAC-assigned IPv6 addresses on macvlan interfaces, enabling IPv6 connectivity without manual static IP configuration.
- **`static_mac` field in NetworkOptions**: Network configuration now supports specifying a static MAC address, enabling deterministic MAC address assignment to containers.
- **MAC address injection into CNI plugins**: Container MAC addresses are now injected into CNI plugin JSON configurations, supporting SLAAC IPv6 detection and MAC-based ACL enforcement.

### Internal

- Set preferred build optimize mode to ReleaseSafe.
- Extracted `reapChild` helper for child process cleanup in SlaacDetector.
- Simplified IPv6 CIDR formatting to use expanded notation.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-08

### Security

- **Bounded systemctl output allocation**: `WorkerManager` previously allocated unbounded heap for systemctl stdout/stderr. A misbehaving `systemd` could exhaust server memory. All three call sites now share a single helper capped at 64 KiB.
- **Log settings applied immediately at startup**: A window existed between the initial boot log and the late-stage config load where log level was not enforced, allowing security-relevant events to be emitted (or dropped) regardless of configuration. Log settings are now applied as the first action after config becomes available, in both server and worker.
- **Network namespace diagnostics gated behind explicit opt-in**: Worker logs previously emitted diagnostic netns information by default. This output is now produced only when explicitly requested, reducing information disclosure to systemd-journal or stdout.
- **OOM propagation in `getUsername`**: Out-of-memory errors during username resolution were masked as a null result, which could silently skip authorization checks. Errors now propagate correctly to the caller.
- **CNI plugin type validated against whitelist**: Plugin type validation now uses a strict whitelist, preventing use of unexpected plugin types via malformed CNI configurations.
- **Visibility into ACL watcher failures**: `setupInotify()` and inotify read errors were silently swallowed, leaving operators running with stale ACL state and no warning that hot-reload was disabled. Both classes of failure now emit explicit warnings.
- **Safe fallbacks for `unreachable` code paths**: Several CNI accessors and utils helpers previously used `unreachable` for unexpected inputs (e.g. corrupted state files bypassing `init()` validation), which is undefined behavior in release builds. These now return null or a safe fallback to avoid memory corruption.

### Added

- **Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT**: The server now catches SIGTERM and SIGINT and performs a clean shutdown instead of being forcibly killed, improving reliability during system updates and container restarts.

### Fixed

- **CNI double-free in `Cni.deinit`**: The `Cni` struct is allocated inside its arena, but `deinit()` additionally called `allocator.destroy(self)` after `arena.deinit()`, freeing already-released memory. The bug was masked under `page_allocator` but caused invalid-free panics under `DebugAllocator`/`GeneralPurposeAllocator`.
- **CNI plugin execution time bounded**: A hanging CNI plugin binary would block `process.wait` indefinitely. With the default 64 handler slots, 64 stuck plugins exhausted the worker pool and caused denial of service. Plugin execution is now bounded by a 60-second timeout via `pidfd_open` + poll on Linux >= 5.3.
- **Handler drain synchronized during shutdown**: `Worker.deinit()` previously tore down the DHCP service without waiting for in-flight handler threads, racing with handlers that call `dhcp_service.ensureStarted()` / `stop()` mid-request. A `shutting_down` flag and `active_handlers` counter now ensure handlers complete before shared resources are freed.
- **Default `config_dir` used when path derivation fails**: When the configured path had no directory component (e.g. a bare `config.json` on fresh installs), `postInit()` returned `InvalidPath`, aborting startup. The default `/etc/net-porter` is now used as a safe fallback.
- **Pre-allocated monitored file descriptors**: Under high load, file descriptor monitoring could silently lose events when capacity was exceeded. Capacity is now pre-allocated to the maximum up front.
- **Stale file descriptor detection via `POLL.NVAL`**: The poll event mask was missing `POLL.NVAL`, leaving stale file descriptors undetected and causing the worker to spin on closed fds. The mask now includes `NVAL` and invalid fds are properly handled.
- **Arena ownership hardened in `ManagedConfig.load`**: The arena ownership contract is now documented and the `FileNotFound` fallback defers `ManagedConfig` construction until after `postInit()` succeeds, eliminating a fragile dual-tracking window where the arena could be cleaned up twice.
- **CNI teardown partial failure visibility**: Partial failures during CNI teardown were silently dropped, hiding real configuration or permission problems. Errors are now logged with full context.
- **Arena key waste on `put` failure**: Keys inserted into the arena before a failed `workers.put` were not cleaned up, slowly leaking memory under sustained allocation pressure. The insert is now ordered to avoid waste on failure.
- **Oversized path handling in `StateFile.statExists`**: File paths exceeding `PATH_MAX` previously triggered undefined behavior in the underlying syscall. Oversized paths are now rejected with a clear error.

### Internal

- **DebugAllocator enabled in debug builds**: Both server and worker now use `std.heap.DebugAllocator` in `Debug`/`ReleaseSafe` builds, catching leaks and double-frees at runtime. `page_allocator` is still used in `ReleaseFast`/`ReleaseSmall` for performance. The GPA lives in the caller and is passed via `Opts.allocator` so it outlives all sub-objects.
- **Test infrastructure uses cryptographic randomness**: Test helpers in `AclScanner.zig` and `TempFileManager.zig` previously seeded `DefaultPrng` from PID alone, making `/tmp` paths predictable and prone to collision in concurrent CI runs. Replaced with `io.random()` to match production code.
- **Thread-safety contract documented for unlocked worker read methods**: Methods that rely on external locking now carry explicit documentation, preventing accidental misuse from future contributors.
- **Build step checks for `kcov` availability**: The `cover` step now detects whether `kcov` is installed before invoking it, producing a clearer error instead of a confusing build failure.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-29

### Security

- **Restored network namespace verification**: Re-enabled NSFS-based verification of resolved network namespace paths to prevent mount replacement attacks. This protection was accidentally disabled in a previous update.
- **Fixed ACL authorization bypass on resource errors**: When network resource resolution encountered an error, subsequent operations could proceed without proper authorization checks. Errors are now correctly propagated and access is properly denied.
- **Fixed memory safety issue in ACL directory watcher**: The ACL watcher thread could access freed memory during shutdown, potentially causing crashes or undefined behavior. The thread now performs a clean shutdown via a dedicated signaling pipe.
- **Improved secure random number generation**: Temporary file creation now uses `std.io.random` for seed generation, eliminating the risk of using partially-initialized random data.

### Changed

- **Static IPAM now requires explicit `addresses` field**: When using static IPAM (`"type": "static"`), the `addresses` array must be explicitly specified in the CNI configuration. Previously, missing addresses were silently inferred, which could lead to unexpected network behavior.

### Fixed

- **Fixed service hang on shutdown**: The service could hang indefinitely during shutdown when the ACL directory watcher was active, requiring a forced kill.
- **Fixed worker becoming unresponsive after socket errors**: Fatal socket errors during connection acceptance could leave the worker process in a zombie-like state, unable to accept new connections.
- **Fixed log configuration not taking effect in worker**: Log level settings from the configuration file were not applied to worker processes — workers always used the default log level regardless of configuration.
- **Fixed DHCP service misdetecting static IP configurations**: The DHCP start/stop logic incorrectly used ACL IP ranges instead of the CNI config's IPAM type to determine whether a resource uses static IP, potentially causing DHCP to be started or stopped unnecessarily.
- **Fixed potential crash on malformed CNI configuration**: Empty or malformed plugin arrays in CNI configuration files could cause the service to panic and crash.
- **Fixed multiple integer overflow issues**: Several timestamp calculations and event loop counters could overflow on long-running or heavily loaded systems, causing incorrect behavior or crashes.
- **Fixed resource leaks in CNI plugin setup**: File descriptors were leaked when setting up CNI plugin directories, and memory was leaked during CNI attachment state serialization.
- **Fixed memory leak in ACL manager**: Out-of-memory conditions during ACL manager initialization were not properly handled, leaking previously allocated resources.
- **Fixed connection hang from error handling gap**: Certain request processing errors were silently swallowed, causing client connections to hang indefinitely without a response.
- **Fixed heap corruption when spawning workers**: A double-free bug during worker process spawning could corrupt the heap and cause unpredictable crashes.
- **Fixed deadlock during shutdown under load**: The shutdown signal could deadlock if the system call was interrupted by a signal, preventing clean service shutdown.
- **Fixed DHCP mutex state corruption**: The DHCP service mutex could be unlocked without being locked first during cleanup, causing undefined behavior.
- **Fixed multiple reliability issues in worker management**: Worker lifecycle management had edge cases causing out-of-bounds access, memory leaks, and incorrect worker death detection.

### Internal

- Added unit tests for CNI static IPAM type detection.
- Replaced non-standard API calls to comply with project coding standards.
- Added build-id to the executable for easier debugging.
- Removed dead code and improved error propagation in internal modules.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-27

### Security

- **Fixed 6 security issues** covering verification bypass, path traversal, process spoofing, UID reuse, and input validation:
  - NSFS verification now uses `statfs` instead of a hardcoded device number, preventing verification bypass on systems with different device numbers.
  - Added strict username validation (`a-zA-Z0-9_-`) to prevent path traversal via malicious NSS/LDAP entries returning crafted usernames.
  - Improved catatonit process verification to resist PID recycling and process name spoofing attacks.
  - Added UID reuse detection: when a user account is deleted and recreated with the same UID but a different username, the old worker is stopped to prevent ACL inheritance.
  - Fixed integer underflow in IPv6 address parsing.
  - Added validation for random seed generation to prevent use of uninitialized values.

### Added

- **Dynamic ACL management**: The service now watches the `acl.d/` directory in real-time. Adding, modifying, or removing ACL files automatically starts or stops the corresponding workers — no manual intervention needed. Previously, ACL changes required a service restart to take effect.

### Fixed

- Fixed potential out-of-bounds read when processing file system events that could cause crashes.
- Fixed service panic when more than 8 users or ACL events were processed simultaneously.
- Fixed several memory leaks in the ACL watcher.
- Fixed incorrect error detection for certain system calls, which could cause operations to fail silently or report wrong errors.
- Fixed transient I/O errors during user scanning causing all workers to be stopped.
- Fixed event ordering: ACL changes are now processed before user login events, ensuring new users are recognized before their socket events arrive.
- Improved ACL watcher efficiency by skipping non-user files (group rule collections and hidden dotfiles).

### Internal

- Added test coverage for UID reuse detection.
- Code formatting cleanup.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-22

### Security

- **Fixed 9 security vulnerabilities** covering path traversal, TOCTOU race conditions, information leakage, and thread safety:
  - Prevented symlink TOCTOU privilege escalation in unix socket creation.
  - Prevented ACL IP restriction bypass via duplicate resource names.
  - Added CNI identifier validation for `net_porter_resource` to prevent injection.
  - Added path traversal validation for plugin type in CNI config loader.
  - Added path traversal validation for group name in ACL loading.
  - Heap-allocated handler to prevent thread data race.
  - Used `getrandom` + `O_EXCL` for secure temporary state file creation.
  - Set umask before state directory creation to restrict permissions.
  - Avoided leaking CNI plugin details (paths, types) to clients in error messages.

### Added

- **Simplified plugin parameter names**: `net_porter_socket` → `socket`, `net_porter_resource` → `resource`. Old parameter names still work but print a deprecation warning.

### Changed

- **`socket` is now a required parameter**: Rootless podman invokes netavark plugins inside a user namespace where `getuid()` returns the mapped UID (0), making automatic socket path detection unreliable. The `socket` path must now be explicitly specified in `podman network create`.

- **CNI module architecture reorganized**: The monolithic `Cni.zig` (1500+ lines) has been split into four focused modules — `Cni`, `CniConfig`, `PluginConf`, and `Attachment` — for better maintainability.
- **Module layout restructured**: Moved `Acl`/`AclFile` to `acl/`, `ManagedType` and `Responser` to `common/`, and shared inotify constants to `utils/Inotify.zig`.

### Fixed

- Fixed use-after-free in CNI `deserializeState` caused by premature `parsed.deinit()`.
- Fixed memory leak of `env_map` in CNI setup and teardown paths.
- Fixed DHCP daemon process not closing stdin/stdout/stderr.
- Fixed stale process reference in DHCP `isAlive` after reaping child process.
- Fixed missing mutex protection for `group_names` in inotify event processing.
- Fixed OOM in `workers.put` not closing pid file descriptors.
- Fixed OOM returning unresolved netns path instead of explicit error.
- Fixed reversed IP ranges (e.g. `10.0.0.10-10.0.0.1`) being silently accepted in `parseIpRange`.
- Fixed ACL initial load errors being silently swallowed instead of logged.
- Fixed rejected IP not included in error log and incorrect log scope.
- Reduced CNI identifier max length from 256 to 128 for consistency.

### Internal

- Merged `setDefaultAclDir`/`setDefaultCniDir` into generic `setDefaultSubDir`.
- Removed redundant `discoverCatatonitPid`, consolidated to `discoverAllCatatonitPids`.
- Removed trivial `Worker.pageAllocator()` wrapper, using `std.heap.page_allocator` directly.
- Removed unused `json.zig`, inlined its single call in `main`.
- Merged identical catatonit/worker branches in `processPollEvents`.
- Extracted `getIpamType`/`getIpamObject` helpers to deduplicate `PluginConf` methods.
- Removed duplicate `shadowCopyObjectMap`, reusing `PluginConf.shadowCopy`.
- Removed empty `AclScanner.deinit` and its call sites.
- Made test step depend on compilation to catch build errors early.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-19

### Security

- **Eliminated privilege escalation risk from namespace entry**: Previous versions ran CNI plugins inside container namespaces as root — a well-known attack vector. This is no longer the case. The root process now never enters any user-controlled namespace.
- **Hardened process isolation**: The server and per-user workers now run under strict systemd security restrictions — each worker has its own isolated service unit with read-only filesystem, minimal Linux capabilities, and syscall filtering. Even if a worker is compromised, the blast radius is severely limited.
- **Fixed 7 security vulnerabilities** found in audit, including path traversal, container name injection, race conditions on socket creation, and information leakage in error messages.
- **Multi-IP static IP validation**: When a container requests multiple static IPs, all of them are now validated against the user's allowed IP ranges (previously only the first IP was checked).
- **Worker internal data protected**: Worker state files are now stored in a root-only directory, preventing regular users from accessing or tampering with them.

### Added

- **Independent per-user worker processes**: The server now spawns a separate worker process for each user. Workers are fully independent — if the server crashes, all workers keep running and serving their users. When the server restarts, it reconnects to existing workers without disruption.
- **Automatic worker restart after package upgrade**: When you upgrade the net-porter package, the server detects that workers are running the old binary and automatically restarts them with the new version.
- **Automatic worker recovery**: If a worker's associated podman infrastructure container restarts, the server detects this and automatically restarts the worker to reconnect.

### Changed

- **ACL identity now based on filename**: The `user` and `group` fields inside ACL files are no longer used — they are silently ignored for backward compatibility. Identity is now determined solely by the filename: `<username>.json` for users, `@<name>.json` for shared rule collections.
- **New `groups` field in ACL**: User ACL files can reference shared rule collections via the `groups` field. For example, `"groups": ["dhcp-users"]` includes all grants from `@dhcp-users.json`. These are NOT Linux user groups — they are simply reusable grant sets.
- **Rule collection files renamed**: Shared rule collection files now use the `@<name>.json` prefix (e.g., `devops.json` → `@devops.json`) to distinguish them from user ACL files.

### Removed

- **`user` and `group` fields from ACL files**: Replaced by filename-based identity. Existing files with these fields continue to work — the fields are silently ignored.
- **`nsenter` dependency**: The `nsenter` command is no longer used or required.
- **`dumpEnv` configuration option**: Removed to reduce attack surface.

### Migration

See the [Migration Guide (0.6 → 1.0)](migration-guide-0.6-to-1.0.md) for step-by-step upgrade instructions.

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Standard CNI configuration directory (`cni.d/`)**: Network resources are now configured using standard CNI 1.0 format files (`.conf` and `.conflist`) in `/etc/net-porter/cni.d/`. Supports single-plugin and chained-plugin configurations. See [CNI Configuration Guide](cni-config.md) for details.
- **File-based attachment persistence**: CNI attachment state is now persisted to disk at `/run/net-porter/{uid}/{container_id}_{ifname}.json`. This enables proper teardown after server restart — previously, a restarted server could not clean up existing CNI attachments.
- **Chained plugin support with `prevResult`**: CNI plugins now properly chain results using the `prevResult` field per CNI 1.0 spec. Each subsequent plugin receives the previous plugin's output, enabling multi-plugin workflows (e.g., macvlan + bandwidth + firewall).
- **CNI config loader validation**: Plugin binaries are validated at load time — the service reports clear errors if a required plugin is missing or not executable.
- **Installer creates `cni.d/` directory**: The package now auto-creates `/etc/net-porter/cni.d/` and installs a standard CNI config example (`00-example.conflist.example`) with DHCP, static IP, and chained plugin usage guides.
- **Config file size limit**: CNI config files are limited to 1 MB to prevent excessive memory usage from malformed or oversized files.
- **New `cni_dir` configuration option**: Allows customizing the CNI config directory path (defaults to `{config_dir}/cni.d`).

### Changed

- **Network configuration moved to `cni.d/` directory**: The `resources` array in `config.json` is no longer used. Each network resource is now a standard CNI config file in `cni.d/`. This is a **breaking change** — see the [Migration Guide (0.5 → 0.6)](migration-guide-0.5-to-0.6.md).
- **CNI config format is now standard CNI 1.0**: The custom `interface` / `ipam` structure has been replaced by standard CNI fields (`type`, `master`, `mode`, `ipam`, etc.) directly in the plugin config. Unknown fields in CNI configs are silently ignored for better compatibility with standard CNI configurations.

### Removed

- **`resources` field from `config.json`**: Network resources are no longer defined inline. Use the `cni.d/` directory instead.

### Fixed

- Added config file size limit (1 MB) to prevent excessive memory usage from malformed files.

### Internal

- Migrated deprecated `std.fs` and `std.os.linux` calls to preferred Zig 0.16.0 APIs.
- Resolved Zig 0.16.0 stdlib API compatibility issues.
- Fixed test memory leaks in CNI module.
- Removed dead `user_sessions` code.

### Migration

See the [Migration Guide (0.5 → 0.6)](migration-guide-0.5-to-0.6.md) for step-by-step upgrade instructions.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **IPvlan network support**: Added ipvlan as a new interface type alongside macvlan. Supports L2, L3, and L3s modes. IPvlan shares the parent interface's MAC address and is useful in environments where MAC address uniqueness cannot be guaranteed.
- **IPv6 support for static IP ranges**: Static IP ACL rules now support IPv6 addresses and ranges (e.g., `2001:db8::1-2001:db8::ff`), enabling dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 configurations.
- **Dual-stack static IP**: Containers can now request both IPv4 and IPv6 static addresses simultaneously. Each address is automatically matched to the correct subnet by address family.
- **Dynamic ACL directory (`acl.d/`)**: Access control rules are now stored as individual JSON files in `/etc/net-porter/acl.d/`. The service watches this directory and applies changes automatically — no restart needed when adding, modifying, or removing ACL files.

### Changed

- **Access control moved to `acl.d/` directory**: ACL rules are no longer defined inside `config.json`. Each user or group has a separate JSON file in `acl.d/`. This makes permission management more modular — add or revoke access by simply adding or removing a file.
- **Stricter interface mode validation**: The `mode` field is now validated per interface type — macvlan modes (`bridge`, `vepa`, `private`, `passthru`) and ipvlan modes (`l2`, `l3`, `l3s`) cannot be mixed. Additionally, ipvlan L3/L3s modes cannot be used with DHCP (use static IP instead).
- **Version shown at startup**: The service now prints its version number at startup.

### Removed

- **`users` field from `config.json`**: The list of users who need sockets is now automatically derived from ACL files.
- **`acl` field from resource definitions**: Access control is no longer defined inline in each resource. Use the `acl.d/` directory instead.

### Migration

See the [Migration Guide (0.4 → 0.5)](migration-guide-0.4-to-0.5.md) for step-by-step upgrade instructions.

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Single-service multi-user mode**: Replaced per-user service instances (`net-porter@<uid>.service`) with a single global `net-porter.service`. One root process now serves all users, reducing resource overhead and operational complexity.
- **Grant-based ACL model**: New per-resource `acl` field with structured grant entries (`{ "user": "alice" }`, `{ "group": "devops" }`) replaces the flat `allow_users`/`allow_groups` arrays. Grants support optional IP range restrictions for static IP resources.
- **Static IP support**: Added static IPAM type with inline `addresses`, `routes`, and `dns` configuration. User-requested static IPs are validated against their ACL grant's allowed IP ranges — no separate IPAM plugin or config files needed.
- **Inline CNI configuration**: Interface and IPAM settings are now defined directly within each resource definition in `config.json`. The `cni.d/` directory is no longer used; CNI plugin configs are generated dynamically from resource definitions.
- **Per-user socket with inotify dynamic management**: Automatically creates/removes per-user unix sockets at `/run/user/<uid>/net-porter.sock` by watching `/run/user/` via inotify. Each socket has `0600` permissions owned by the user, ensuring OS-level isolation.
- **Top-level `users` config**: New `users` field to explicitly declare which users need a socket entry, replacing the previous implicit derivation from ACL grants.
- **Multi-user container network isolation**: Despite the single-service architecture, each user's container network resources remain strictly isolated — users cannot interfere with or affect each other's containers.
- **Mandatory ACL validation at startup**: Service refuses to start if any resource lacks ACL configuration, preventing resources from being accidentally exposed without access controls.
- **Netns diagnostics in errors**: Network namespace information is now included in connection error messages returned to netavark, aiding troubleshooting.

### Changed

- **Build toolchain upgraded to Zig 0.16.0**: The entire codebase has been migrated to Zig 0.16.0's `std.Io` architecture. Building from source now requires Zig >= 0.16.0.
- **Systemd service simplified**: `net-porter@<uid>.service` template replaced with single `net-porter.service`. The `--uid` CLI argument has been removed.
- **Configuration format redesigned**: See the [Migration Guide (0.3 → 0.4)](migration-guide-0.3-to-0.4.md) for details.

### Removed

- **`domain_socket` config section**: Socket paths are now derived automatically from user UIDs; manual socket configuration is no longer needed.
- **`allow_users` / `allow_groups` fields on resources**: Replaced by the new `acl` grant array.
- **`cni.d/` directory**: CNI configuration files are no longer read from disk. All network settings are defined inline in `config.json`.
- **`net-porter@.service` template**: Replaced by the single `net-porter.service` unit file.
- **`--uid` CLI argument**: No longer needed with the single-service architecture.
